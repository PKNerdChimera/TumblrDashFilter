# TumblrDashFilter
An extension meant to allow you to filter posts on your dashboard. Mainly helpful for those that wish to see posts from multiple different accounts at once easily.


There's nothing actually here yet, but this was made mostly for those that want their dashboard filtered based on who they currently want to see (as an example, they run an askblog, and want to filter only for other askbloggers so they can easily see their posts.

The filters are meant to be easily toggled and can be edited at will.

Not released yet because it currently doesn't exist. That will change later.
